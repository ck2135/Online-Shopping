**Project Title:** Online-Shopping

**Project Description:**
This project aims to develop an online shopping platform using ReactJS that utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve product data and categories from a server. Upon accessing the platform, users will be able to browse through different categories of products, view details of individual items, and add them to their shopping cart.

**User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to secure the shopping experience. Users can sign up, log in, and maintain their profiles.

**Product Catalog:** Display a list of products categorized into different sections such as electronics, clothing, accessories, etc. Users can navigate through these categories to find desired items.

**Fetch API Integration:** Utilize the Fetch API to retrieve product data from a backend server. This data will include information such as product name, description, price, and availability.

**Product Detail Page:** Upon selecting a product, users can view detailed information about it, including images, specifications, and reviews.

**Add to Cart Functionality:** Implement an "Add to Cart" button on each product detail page. When clicked, the selected item will be added to the user's shopping cart.

**Shopping Cart Management:** Allow users to view their shopping cart, modify quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout.

**Checkout Process:** Implement a checkout process where users can review their order, enter shipping details, and choose payment options.
